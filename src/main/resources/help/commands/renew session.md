Command: renew session

Renews the current session, extending the time required before another login is required.

This is used for the Institutional Login option where access is granted on a short term basis with expiry set for 10 days from the time of renewal.
The command may be useful when you have long running workflows and want to avoid subsequent login steps.

Example usage:

    renew session
