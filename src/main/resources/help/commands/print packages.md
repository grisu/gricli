Command: print packages 

List all application packages available to you.

Note that application packages are bound to queues so you must ensure the queue you submit to can support the
package you would like to use. This will be taken care of when you set the queue to 'auto'.

If you set the queue manually, use the 'print package <application_package>' command to check that the application and the version you would
like to use are supported by the queue.

Example usage:

    print packages
