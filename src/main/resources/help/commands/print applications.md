Command: print applications 

List all application packages available to you.

Note that applications are bound to queues so you must ensure the queue you submit to can support the
package you would like to use. This will be taken care of when you set the queue to 'auto'.

If you set the queue manually, use the 'print application <application>' command to check that the applicaiton and the version you would
like to use is supported by the queue.

Example usage:

    print applications
