Topic: Globals
===============

Globals define the properties of a job.

Overview
---------

Globals are the properties for a job. They let you determine how and where your job will be executed.
To see the list of globals use the command 'print globals'.
You may use the 'set' command to set any of the global properties.
To view an individual property use the command 'print global <global>'.

To view information and examples on each global use the command 'help <global>'.
Note that you may use a Gricli script to automate the task of setting globals.
For more information see use the command 'help run'.

Example usage:

    print globals
    print global memory
    set memory 1g
    help memory
    help global memory
