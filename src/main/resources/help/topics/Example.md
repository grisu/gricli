Topic: Globals

Globals define the properties of a job.

You may use the 'set' command to set any of the global properties.
To view a list of properties and their values use the command 'print globals'.
To view an individual property use the command 'print global <global>'.

To view information and examples on each global use the command 'help <global>'

Example usage:

    print globals
    print global memory
    set global memory
    help memory
    help global memory
